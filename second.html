 <h1>How To play </h1>

 <h2 >  The bird flaps upward each time you mouseclick;

If the bird touches the pipes, you lose. <br>
if the mouse is not clicked, the bird falls because of gravity.<br> 

You earn a point when you sucessfully navigate a pair of pipes.<br>

There is no variation or evolution in gameplay throughout the game,<br>
as the pipes always have the same gap between them and there is no end to the running track,<br>
having only the flap sounds. <br>
